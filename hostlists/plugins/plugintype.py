"""
hostlists plugin to recursively query plugins based on type.

This makes it possible to obtain lists of hosts by recursively
querying multiple backends.

For example:
   * Query dns for www.foo.com
   * Get a list of two hostnames back haproxy1.ny.foo.com and
     haproxy1.lax.foo.com.
   * Query reverse proxies and load balancers for the
     above two hostnames and the names of any hosts serving
     the traffic for them.  haproxy1.ny.foo.com is a vip being
     served by apache1.ny.foo.com ad apache2.ny.foo.com.
     haproxy1.lax.foo.com is a vip being serviced by
     apache2.lax.foo.com, apache3.lax.foo.com and
     joesdesktop.foo.com.
   * Return apache[1-2].ny.foo.com, apache[2-3].lax.foo.com,
     joesdektop.foo.com
